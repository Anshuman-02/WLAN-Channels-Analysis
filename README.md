# WLAN Channel Analysis Using MATLAB

This project analyzes the impact of WLAN fading SISO/MIMO channels on received waveforms using the WLAN Toolbox in MATLAB. Various WLAN standards and scenarios were simulated, including S1G, VHT, HT, and Non-HT waveforms.

## **Features:**
- **SISO Analysis:**
  - S1G waveform through TGah channel.
  - VHT waveform through TGac channel.
  - HT waveform through TGn channel.
  - Non-HT waveform through 802.11g channel.
- **MIMO Analysis:**
  - VHT waveform through TGac 4x3 MIMO channel.

## **Contents:**
1. MATLAB Scripts:
   - `PassS1G_TGah.m`: S1G TGah SISO channel.
   - `PassVHT_TGac_SISO.m`: VHT TGac SISO channel.
   - `PassHT_TGn_SISO.m`: HT TGn SISO channel.
   - `PassNonHT_80211g.m`: Non-HT 802.11g channel.
   - `PassVHT_TGac_MIMO.m`: VHT TGac MIMO channel.
2. **Project Report**: Detailed report with results and screenshots.

## **Usage:**
- Run the scripts in MATLAB to simulate and analyze the waveform behavior under various channel conditions.

## **Requirements:**
